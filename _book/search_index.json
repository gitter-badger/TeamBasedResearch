Through this course you will gain expertise in team-science concepts and approaches, including: + team building, + team diversity and social sensitivity, + effective individual and team communication, + collaboration tools and strategies, + constructive/destructive group behaviors, + conflict resolution, + individual and team time/project management, + creating effective team policies, procedures, and expectations, including authorship and data sharing policies, + assessing team functioning, + collaborative manuscript and proposal writing, and + collaborative presentations. As teams you will employ these team-science skills to develop an interdisciplinary research proposal, to conduct preliminary research that aligns with the proposed project, and to develop and deliver an oral presentation of their proposed research and preliminary results. Towards developing a research proposal and conducting preliminary analyses, students will work together to develop the teamâ€™s rules of conduct and a project plan or roadmap. The team will work together to review relevant literature, to initiate preliminary analyses, coding, or modeling, to identify individual and team-oriented tasks, and to set milestones. The course will culminate with submission of a fully developed research proposal and team presentations of their proposed research project, preliminary results, and potential future directions.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).
