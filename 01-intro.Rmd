# Course Logistics & Schedule {#intro}

First offering of this course. 
May adjust the course plan and materials as the semester progresses, in response to feedback and experiences, but we will let you know of changes to the plan, schedule, activities, and/or grading system.
We will maintain a “live” course schedule on the course Wiki
